## Greetings from yours truly!

I'm Tanmay Vemuri. I'm a student at Manipal Institute of Technology, Bangalore and as such I'm quite clueless about the world with the confidence that everything will eventually fall into place.

Looking to learn, earn and kick ass, all with my keyboard, trusty laptop and coffee â˜•

âš¡**Fun fact**: I'm a coffee addict ðŸ˜…

I'm Currently working on:
  - Migrating personal codebase to SYCL (DPC++)
  - Studying for GATE
  - Finding an internship
  - Projects that focus on HPC (visual projects like path tracing, AI, cellular automata, fractals etc.)
  
I'm currently learning: SYCL coding for convenient, multi-platform parallelism

âš¡*Fun fact:* I'm still in the challenge and at any time I can start the next challenge, I'm just hoping to be a bit more....*educated* the next time I go for it.
